## About Project

I fell ill while in graduate school and was hospitalized for a few days. The recovery took a few more days, so I was unable to attend classes or submit assignments. I was advised to use task management to organize my assignments and prioritize them based on deadlines. This project was developed as a way to make prioritizing assignments easier. I also wanted to learn about the technologies involved, and this project is being submitted as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program's Portfolio Project.
